A smart contract to buy all the tokens from https://guild.xyz/arbitrum in one go.

Originally from this contract: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13c2910c06f6f8648Cb01d4f20AD8FA1d3868a17#writeContract

I added ELK and removed the fee.

Calling bundlePurchase() with 0.001 ETH should work. I didn't test this.
